          <h2><span>North Star Airlines:</span> A Fading Giant</h2> 
    
          <p>North Star Airlines was a profitable business with a relatively healthy userbase. However, like many airlines in recent years, increased competition and technological advancements had begun to cause falls in revenue and passenger numbers. The CMO realised that to turn it around, he would have to find a new way to engage existing passengers and attract new customers.</p>
       
          <p>North Star quickly realised that there were a lot of platforms that claimed to do just that but none of them were advaanced enough to make a real impact. They wanted to find something that could help them engage and understand their customers and deliver real-time relevant content to their passengers. They also wanted  to find a partner that understood the unique challenges of the airline industry that  could handle a high user base as well as enabling North Star to target users based on existing CRM data and previous passenger purchases.</p>

          <h2><span>The Solution:</span> Pulsate Ascend</h2>

          <p>After months of searching, North Star discovered Pulsate Ascend. Both companies held a number of product discovery and strategy workshops. Pulsate Ascend was able to use their experience working with other airlines to advise North Star about how to get the best results. The lightweight Pulsate Ascend SDK was integrated into North Star's existing Android and iOS Apps in less than two hours. Now they were ready to take their first steps towards context aware mobile engagement.</p>
           
          <h3>Improve Customer Experience</h3>
           
          <p>Now that North Star could communicate directly with their customers based on each user's current context and location, they set about improving every part of the customer journey. They started sending their customer's really useful information such as real-time flight info, advice on beating the queues at the airport, relevant data on flight destinations and final checks before leaving for the airport. With Pulsate Ascend, they could automatically send this info to each customer when it was most relevant for their customers.</p>
           
          <h3>Increase Bookings</h3>
           
          <p>North Star used Pulsate Ascend to group their customers into segments based on their CRM data and past purchase history. These segments were then targeted with incredibly focused campaigns based on the a host of factors including user's actual interests and current location. Sun worshippers in the USA  were sent details of the latest flight to the Caribbean whereas sun lovers in Europe were targeted with campaigns for flights to Mediterranean resorts. Snow lovers received campaigns focused on the best destinations for winter sports. This greatly improved customer engagement and passenger bookings.</p>
           
          <h3>Increase Sales from Add-Ons and In-Flight Services</h3>
           
          <p>North Star always found it difficult communicating great partnership deals with their customers. With Pulsate Ascend they were not only able to get the message out but also target users partner offers and addons when customers were most likely to act on them.</p>

          <p>Passengers who booked tickets were sent hotel recommendations in the weeks leading up to the flight and given the option to beat the security and boarding queues on way to the airport, especially if they were running late. Before their flight, passengers were also offered a choice of meals and entertainment packages that they could order directly from their mobile device. As passengers explored their destination during their holiday, North Star sent them recommendations for nearby special attractions and restaurants.</p>

          <h2><span>The Results:</span> Engaged Customers and Bigger Profits</h2>

          <p>North Star Airlines used Pulsate Ascend to improve their market position and their bottom line. Customers became much more engaged with the brand and in app transactions took off. Customer's loved the measures North Star took to improve the customer experience at every step of the journey. Sales of partnership deals and inflight services also surged. North Star are currently trialling Pulsate Ascend's new wearables SDK and working on improving their mobile context based customer engagement even further.
